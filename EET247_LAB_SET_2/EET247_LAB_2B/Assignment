 
PROBLEM SET 2:  INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 
 
LAB ASSIGNMENT – 2B:  Loan Amortization Calculator 
 
Overview: 
Banks are happy to give a person a loan for a car, house, business, or for other reasons.  They are happy to do it because they make money off of your loan.  
They charge you interest which is amortized over a period of time.  On a typical home mortgage, the homeowner pays more in interest to the bank than he/she pays for the house.  

Objective: 
Using your textbook, notes and personal research material, write a program using the C Programming language that will display the desired output
on the command screen per the specifications provided. NOTE: Your source code/program should be well documented as outlined in Handout #2 and 
contain at least 1 function call to a function that you created. 
 
Specifications: 
Input:  From keyboard: Purchase Price, Down payment, Annual interest rate and Number of payments 
 
Process: Perform the required math processes on the inputs per the following information: 
 
𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 = iP / 1−(1 +𝑖)^−𝑛 
 
Where: 
P = Principal (the amount you borrow) 
i = monthly interest rate (1/12  of the annual rate) 
n = total number of payments 
 
Output:   Clear the screen and then display your name, 
          Purchase Price, 
          Down Payment,
          Principal Borrowed,
          Number of Payments, 
          Annual interest rate, 
          Monthly payment and 
          Total Amount repaid. 

Relevant Dollar and Percent signs are to be included. 
Displayed values should reflect two decimal points. 

Your output must look the depiction on page 3 to receive full consideration. 

REPORTING:  
1. Submit your executable file 
2. Documented source code 
2. Screen shot of your output
3. ZIP file for proper consideration. 

Provide screenshots of at least 3 different loan amounts,
interest rates and the number of payments.  

As part of your source code documentation, identify any limits to the expected input, output and/or processing.
